      <p>
        I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Yale University,
        advised by Professor Dionysis Kalogerias. My research lies at
        the intersection of risk-averse optimization with flavors in dynamics over
        space of data distribution. I try to apply my theoretical works in domains like federated learning
        were data heterogeneousness and distributional shifts are inherent challenges.

        Applications of my research include reliable and fair machine learning systems, robust decision-making,
        and adverse generative modeling.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to Yale, I received dual Bachelor of Science degrees in
        <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> and <strong>Mathematics</strong> from
        <em>Sharif University of Technology</em>. I am also a silver medalist in the <strong>Iranian National Mathematical Olympiad</strong>,
        which shaped my interest in geometry and bias toward structrulism point of view in my research.

      <p>
        My work investigates the <strong>geometry and dynamics of probability measures</strong>, with a focus on
        <em>information geometry</em>, <em>optimal transport</em>, and the <em>Wasserstein space</em>. I study how learning
        algorithms evolve on non-Euclidean manifolds of distributions and how curvature, divergence, and flow properties
        shape optimization landscapes, statistical efficiency, and generalization.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        A core line of research applies these geometric tools to <strong>Fair Learning</strong> and
        <strong>Federated Learning</strong>. Federated systems exhibit heterogeneous, non-IID data and intermittent client
        participation, which can bias aggregation and degrade guarantees. I develop transport- and divergence-based
        aggregation and adaptation schemes that respect fairness constraints, improve stability under partial or biased
        participation, and preserve statistical consistency under realistic communication limits.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In parallel, I work on <strong>Risk-Averse Optimization</strong> and <strong>Distributionally Robust Optimization
        (DRO)</strong> for decision-making under uncertainty. Using tools from convex analysis, stochastic approximation,
        and variational principles, I design and analyze algorithms that control tail risk (e.g., via CVaR) and remain
        robust under distributional shifts. This connects geometric perspectives on learning with robust control and
        quantitative modeling, yielding methods that are both theoretically grounded and practically reliable.
