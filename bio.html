      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Yale University,
        where I am advised by Professors Dionysis Kalogerias and Amin Karbasi.
        My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, optimization,
        information theory, and reinforcement learning â€” with recent focus on federated learning,
        risk-aware optimization, and information geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to Yale, I received dual Bachelor of Science degrees in
        <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> and <strong>Mathematics</strong> from
        <em>Sharif University of Technology</em>. During my undergraduate studies,
        I was a Head Teaching Assistant for several core courses and actively involved in theoretical research
        on the geometry of deep learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also been a silver medalist in the <strong>Iranian National Mathematical Olympiad</strong>,
        which shaped my interest in mathematical rigor and abstraction â€” a theme that continues
        to influence both my research and teaching today.

      <h2>Job Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently open to exciting research and industry opportunities in areas related to
        <strong>Risk-Averse Optimization</strong>, <strong>Optimal Transport</strong>, and
        <strong>Quantitative Research</strong>. My background spans both theoretical and applied aspects of these fields,
        with a strong focus on machine learning, stochastic optimization, and financial modeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, I have been actively exploring quantitative research directions through experiments and modeling efforts,
        the results of which can be found here:

          Quantitative Research Projects â†—
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also interested in voluntary teaching positions, especially in <strong>Statistics</strong> and 
        <strong>Mathematical Olympiad training</strong>. Sharing mathematical insights and mentoring motivated students has 
        always been a rewarding part of my academic journey.
