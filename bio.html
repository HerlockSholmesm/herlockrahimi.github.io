      <p>
        I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering(ECE) at Yale University,
        advised by Professor <a href="https://www.dkalogerias.org/" target="_blank">Prof. Dionysis Kalogerias</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to Yale, I completed dual Bachelor of Science degrees in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> and <strong>Pure Mathematics</strong> at the Sharif University of Technology. Before that, I ranked 9th nationwide in Iran’s National University Entrance Examination and earned a silver medal in the Iranian National Mathematical Olympiad.

      <p>
        My research is rooted in <strong> the spectral calculus of linear and nonlinear operators</strong>, especially as it arises in infinite-dimensional spaces. I am broadly interested in how the spectral and geometric structure of an operator—or a family of operators—governs the behavior of the dynamical, probabilistic, and optimization systems built upon it. This perspective places operator theory, harmonic analysis, and variational methods at the foundation of everything I study.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        A central application domain of my work is dynamical systems and Markov semigroup theory, where generators such as Laplacians, Fokker–Planck operators, and transport-type operators encode the evolution of probability measures. I study how spectra, functional calculus, resolvents, and semigroup dissipativity control long-term behavior such as mixing, decay of correlations, stability, hyperbolicity, and Lyapunov exponents. This connects directly to modern probabilistic dynamics, including sampling algorithms, Langevin-type diffusions, Hamiltonian flows, and Wasserstein/Hellinger–Kantorovich gradient flows, which can be understood through spectral or pseudo-spectral properties of their generators.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        At the same time, I am interested in the deep connections between spectral theory and constrained optimization, especially in stochastic or measure-theoretic settings. Many risk-sensitive and distributionally robust problems—such as CVaR minimization, f-divergence–constrained optimization, and robust moment problems—can be reformulated via operator inequalities, dual representations, variational envelopes, and convex conjugates. I explore how spectral gaps, monotone operators, and resolvent identities provide new perspectives on robustness, regularization, and algorithmic convergence.
      </p>

      <p>
        A unifying theme across my work is the belief that spectral geometry provides the right language for understanding uncertainty, robustness, and long-term behavior. Whether studying Markov processes, semigroup ergodicity, accelerated sampling, or distributionally robust optimization, I aim to build a mathematical bridge between operator-theoretic structure and modern algorithmic performance. This includes investigating how spectral properties influence convergence rates, tail behavior, sensitivity, optimization landscapes, and the interplay between constraints and dynamics. Ultimately, my interests lie at the intersection of operator theory, stochastic dynamics, and optimization under uncertainty, unified by the view that spectral calculus is a powerful tool for analyzing and designing algorithms that are stable, robust, and geometrically principled.
